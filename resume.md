## Introduction {#introduction}

My name is Kai Miyazawa.  
I am from Hokkaido, born in 2003, and currently living in Tokyo.  
I am currently studying at Waseda University and also learning at 42Tokyo.

## Overview {#overview}

As a student at 42Tokyo, I have learned the fundamentals of computer science.  
In August 2023, I established and have been running an IT-related university club.  
Since April 2024, I have belonged to a university research lab, where I am learning about language information science, machine learning, and data analysis.

## Technical & Soft Skills {#skills}

### Technical Skills {#tech-skills}

- Experience in team development using Git/GitHub (1.5 years)
- Basic mobile app development using Dart and Flutter (6 months)
- Development experience in C/C++ (1.5 years)
- Experience in data analysis and machine learning using Python (1 year)

### Soft Skills {#soft-skills}

- **Communication skills**  
  I am comfortable with casual conversations and do not feel stress when engaging with others. I am also respectful in my communications, ensuring not to be rude.

- **Leadership**  
  I have the ability to lead and manage a group.

- **Self-directed learning**  
  At 42Tokyo, there are no teachers, and self-study is encouraged, along with peer reviews. I have ample experience catching up on things I do not understand on my own and am motivated to do so.

## Work History {#work-history}

No engineering-related work history.

## Self-PR {#self-pr}

- **42Tokyo Activities**  
  I have worked on group projects, including a two-person project where we implemented a simple bash in C language. The learning environment at 42Tokyo is based on peer reviews without teachers, so I am confident in my self-directed learning ability.

- **Fostering an Engineering Culture in the Club**  
  In the club I established, I have worked to create a culture where members recognize and support each other. As of August 2024, the club has about 35 members, and it was officially recognized by the university in July 2024.

- **Research on Machine Learning and LLMs at University**  
  Since April 2024, I have belonged to a language information science laboratory, and as of August 2024, I am considering my research theme. In this process, I am learning about language processing, acoustic analysis, machine learning, and LLMs according to my interests.
